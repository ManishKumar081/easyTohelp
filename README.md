# EasyToHelp – Smart Academic Resource & Support Platform

## 🚀 Problem Statement
In colleges like **NIT Agartala**, students often face difficulties in accessing academic resources such as subject notes, important files, and department-specific study material.  
Currently, most sharing happens informally through messaging apps, leading to:

- Inefficiency  
- Duplication of content  
- Lack of structured access  

There is a need for a centralized platform where students can **upload, access, and manage academic content efficiently**, while ensuring smooth interaction across departments.  
**EasyToHelp bridges this gap** by providing a dedicated, role-based platform for managing academic resources with authentication and structured access.
